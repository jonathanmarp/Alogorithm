### This app only plays with coordinates. Just for test
- If you want to test, you can see the `test` folder.
- And to `bin`. Run the application "Algorithm.exe". 
- Warning it is very important to run the application in the bin folder. 
- Otherwise the application does not run properly
- See the "Algorithm" folder section in `test`. And to "data". 
- And try to open "data.json". The file is to add whatever the application will open. 
- In "pages" for the file to be opened.
